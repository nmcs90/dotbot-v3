# Create Deep Dive Tasks

This workflow runs after the foundational research (Phase 1) completes. It reads the repo impact inventory, filters to repos that need deep analysis, and creates one task per repo.

## Prerequisites

- Phase 1 research must be complete — `research-repos.md` must exist
- `jira-context.md` must exist for Jira key and initiative context

## Your Task

### Step 1: Read Source Documents

```
Read({ file_path: ".bot/workspace/product/research-repos.md" })
Read({ file_path: ".bot/workspace/product/briefing/jira-context.md" })
```

### Step 2: Parse Repo Tables

Parse the tier tables from `research-repos.md`. Each tier section contains a table with columns:

| Repo | Project | Purpose | Impact |
|------|---------|---------|--------|

Extract for each row:
- **Repo** — the repository name
- **Project** — the Azure DevOps project
- **Purpose** — what the repo does
- **Impact** — HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or LOW-MEDIUM

### Step 3: Filter MEDIUM+ Repos

Select only repos with impact **MEDIUM** or **HIGH**. These are the repos that need detailed deep dive analysis.

Order by:
1. Tier (lower tier = higher priority)
2. Impact (HIGH before MEDIUM)

### Step 4: Create Tasks

Use `task_create_bulk` to create one task per filtered repo.

**Important:** Each deep-dive task must list the IDs of the 3 Phase 1 research tasks (Atlassian, internet, repos) in its `dependencies` array, so the runtime won't pick them up until all Phase 1 research is committed and merged. Retrieve the Phase 1 task IDs by checking the `done` folder or querying task status before creating deep-dive tasks.

```
mcp__dotbot__task_create_bulk({
  tasks: [
    // For each MEDIUM+ repo:
    {
      "name": "Deep dive: {RepoName}",
      "description": "Conduct a thorough code-level analysis of the {RepoName} repository. Clone the repo, analyse source code, database scripts, configuration, and tests. Produce a structured deep-dive report.\n\nTier: {TIER}\nImpact: {IMPACT}\nProject: {PROJECT}\nPurpose: {PURPOSE}\n\nOutput: .bot/workspace/product/briefing/repos/{RepoName}.md",
      "category": "research",
      "effort": "{EFFORT_BASED_ON_IMPACT}",
      "priority": "{PRIORITY_BASED_ON_ORDER}",
      "dependencies": ["{PHASE1_ATLASSIAN_TASK_ID}", "{PHASE1_INTERNET_TASK_ID}", "{PHASE1_REPOS_TASK_ID}"],
      "research_prompt": "repo-deep-dive.md",
      "external_repo": {
        "project": "{PROJECT}",
        "repo": "{RepoName}"
      },
      "tier": {TIER_NUMBER},
      "impact": "{IMPACT}",
      "working_dir": "repos/{RepoName}",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Repo cloned to repos/{RepoName}/ on initiative branch",
        "Deep dive report written to .bot/workspace/product/briefing/repos/{RepoName}.md",
        "Reference implementation file inventory complete",
        "Files requiring changes identified with change types",
        "New files needed listed with proposed paths",
        "Database impact assessed",
        "Effort estimated with T-shirt sizes",
        "Risk flags and open questions documented"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Clone repo using repo_clone MCP tool (project: {PROJECT}, repo: {RepoName})",
        "Read jira-context.md and prior research documents for context",
        "Read this repo's entry from research-repos.md for tier/impact context",
        "Analyse repo structure and orientation",
        "Map reference implementation files",
        "Identify entity-specific code paths",
        "Assess configuration-driven vs code-driven areas",
        "Analyse database impact",
        "Review API contracts and test coverage",
        "Identify dependencies on other repos",
        "Write structured deep-dive report to .bot/workspace/product/briefing/repos/{RepoName}.md",
        "Create per-repo workspace: repos/{RepoName}/.bot/workspace/{product,tasks}/"
      ],
      "applicable_standards": [".bot/prompts/standards/global/research-output.md"],
      "applicable_agents": [".bot/prompts/agents/researcher/AGENT.md"]
    }
  ]
})
```

### Effort Estimation Rules

| Impact | Default Effort |
|--------|---------------|
| HIGH   | L             |
| MEDIUM | M             |

### Priority Assignment

Assign priorities sequentially starting from 10 (to leave room after the foundational research tasks at priority 1-3):
- Tier 1 HIGH repos: priority 10-19
- Tier 1 MEDIUM repos: priority 20-29
- Tier 2 HIGH repos: priority 30-39
- And so on...

### Step 5: Verify Creation

After `task_create_bulk` returns, verify:
1. All tasks created successfully
2. Each task has `research_prompt: "repo-deep-dive.md"`
3. Each task has `external_repo` with project and repo name
4. Each task has `tier` and `impact` fields
5. Each task has `working_dir` pointing to its clone path

Report the result:
- Total repos found in `research-repos.md`
- Repos filtered (MEDIUM+)
- Tasks created
- Repos skipped (LOW/LOW-MEDIUM impact)

## Output

One task per MEDIUM+ impact repo in `.bot/workspace/tasks/todo/`, each with:
- `category: "research"`
- `research_prompt: "repo-deep-dive.md"`
- `external_repo: { project, repo }`
- `tier` and `impact` fields
- `working_dir` pointing to clone path

## Critical Rules

- Parse tables carefully — handle variations in whitespace and formatting
- Only create tasks for MEDIUM and HIGH impact repos
- Skip LOW and LOW-MEDIUM repos (they can be assessed later if needed)
- Include the ADO project name from the table (needed for `repo_clone`)
- Do NOT clone repos — task execution will handle cloning
- Do NOT execute deep dives — only create the tasks
- If `research-repos.md` contains no MEDIUM+ repos, report that and create zero tasks
